# Vulnerability-Assessment-

This project was developed as part of a **group project** for my graduation from the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**. The primary goal of this project was to conduct a comprehensive **vulnerability assessment** of networked systems and web applications, aiming to identify security flaws and recommend measures to strengthen system defenses.

## Key Features
- **Reconnaissance and Scanning:** Collecting system intelligence and analyzing network infrastructure for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Web Application Testing:** Identifying and assessing web-based vulnerabilities.
- **Exploitation:** Crafting and executing exploits to validate discovered vulnerabilities (**my primary responsibility in the project**).
- **Penetration Testing Workflow:** Following systematic methodologies for testing and reporting findings.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Producing professional, actionable reports on vulnerabilities, risk levels, and mitigation strategies.
